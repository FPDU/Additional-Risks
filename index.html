<a id="risk-of-device-implantation" class="anchor" href="#risk-of-device-implantation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Risk of device implantation</strong>
</h3>

<p>The risks associated with having surgery and placing the medical devices in your body. These risks might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long-term pain.</li>
<li>Shortening the remaining limb.</li>
<li>Cutting a nerve. You could lose some muscle control or some of your sense of touch</li>
<li>Device failure. You may have to have more surgery to have the device removed or repaired</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="skin-injury" class="anchor" href="#skin-injury" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Skin injury</strong>
</h3>

<p>You may have no skin irritation or injury with some prostheses. With some prostheses there may be a chance of skin irritation. With other prostheses there may be a risk that your skin could be injured. In that case you could need treatment or need to refit the prosthesis.</p>

<h3>
<a id="compensatory-movements-and-overuse-injuries" class="anchor" href="#compensatory-movements-and-overuse-injuries" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Compensatory movements and overuse injuries</strong>
</h3>

<p>With some prostheses, your movements will be similar to movements with an intact limb. These prostheses put you at less risk for long-term pain or injury. With some prostheses, you may use movements that are different from when a person is using an intact limb. These types of movements can lead to long-term pain or injury.</p>

<h3>
<a id="long-term-limitations" class="anchor" href="#long-term-limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Long-term limitations</strong>
</h3>

<p>As a result of having a medical device inside your body, you may be unable to have:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Additional implanted prostheses:</em> The prosthesis you choose may become outdated. Because of the surgeries you have gone through, you may not be a candidate for even newer prostheses.</li>
<li>
<em>An implanted neural stimulator:</em> Neural stimulators are used to help with bladder or bowel control, to treat muscle tremors, or to treat long-term pain.</li>
<li>
<em>An implanted cardiac device:</em> Cardiac devices are used to treat many heart conditions. For example, they might restart the heart after a heart attack.</li>
<li>
<em>An implanted drug pump:</em> Drug pumps are used to deliver medication for long-term pain.</li>
<li>
<em>An MRI scan:</em> MRI scans may help with diagnosing many diseases, such as stroke, heart disease, cancer, pain, and Alzheimerâ€™s disease.</li>
</ul>

<a id="risk-of-deciding-not-to-use-the-prosthesis" class="anchor" href="#risk-of-deciding-not-to-use-the-prosthesis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Risk of deciding not to use the prosthesis</strong>
</h3>

<p>After you have surgery and learn to use the new prosthesis, you may decide you do not like the new prosthesis enough to use it. About 20 out of 100 people decide to stop using current prostheses that do not require surgery. The risk with new prostheses may be lower, the same, or higher.</p>
